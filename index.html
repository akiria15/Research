            The image above is the first headphones that were advertised.
            The headphones of this time were invented for commercial and to be used by people. 
            They did not fully succeed because they were so expensive. 
            Not many people bought them or were able to afford them. 
            Many designs and prototypes were created. 
            The most popular and known design was similar to the look of a stethoscope.
            The headphones were said to give people the opportunity to hear songs from the opera through them. 
            Everyone wanted that experience, many people just were not priveledged enough to get that.

            Above is an image of this era of headphones.
            The headphones of this time were created by AKG. 
            Unlike the fist headphones, these wre a little less expensive due to them not being products of opera music.
            The purpose and goal of these being created was to have a different pproach in the use of headphones.
            These were seen to be used for sound and not specifically art like mmusic. 
            The intentions of these were to hear things privately or better access to diffeent things that people enjoy listening to.

            The headphones of this time held great value.
            They came with metal headbands and they were lightweight.
            As they hit the industry, it was very noticeable that they were a big change from the most recently known headphones.
            These headphones molded the design for others that came out during this time.
            No value can be placed because they were the first to change the whole look and meaning of headphones.

            Here is an image of the QC1.
            As time progressed from the last change in headphones, these were invented and used for noise cancelling.
            Originally used by pilots and passengers on the plane along with them.
            The objective goalof these were noise cancellation, which explains why they were used mostly by that audience of people.
